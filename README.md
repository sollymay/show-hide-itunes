# Show/Hide iTunes window

This little workflow lets you show/hide the iTunes window either by using a hotkey combo or by setting a keyword.

Why would I create this??? Well, because I use the iTunes mini player and needed an easy way of avoiding my hands moving off the keyboard.

Finding a way to invoke the mini player (then search for my music using CMD + F) and then dismissing the mini player was needed, well, at least for me.

Yes, I know that Alfred has a mini player, but I don't like the lack of Apple Music search functionality, etc.

## Usage

* By default this workflow is set to use the CMD + G but you can easily change it to anything you want through the workflow settings

My personal usage has been as follows:
* I open iTunes (normally open at startup)
* I invoke mini player mode (shift + CMD + M) if it is not already activated
* I use CMD + G to show the iTunes mini player window and hide it, and CMD + F to search for music. When done, I use CMD + G to dismiss (hide) the window
